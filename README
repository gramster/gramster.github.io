If updating theme, make sure to change layouts/partials/footer.html to include:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML">
</script>

TODO
- affiliate links
- RSS icon seems busted
- Books section
- More tags
- publish and push to Github
- for pages that have image headers (like personality page) replace the forest
