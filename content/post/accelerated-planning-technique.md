[Bob Walsh has just
discussed](http://www.todoorelse.com/2006/08/clarify_your_pl.html) an
interesting approach to planning called Accelerated Planning Technique
from a New Zealand management consultant. Its worth going through the
[mini online seminar](http://www.aptplan.com/intro/000000_Start.htm). It
seems pretty woolly and wordy at first, but the example at the end of
the business plan for a restaurant is pretty good.
