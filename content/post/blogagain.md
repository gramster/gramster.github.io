Well, it's been quite a while since I last blogged. My Zite project is not dead; it's actually up and 
running well as a personal aggregator but not ready for multi-user access, and I'm not sure when it
might be. But I've been feeling a bit of an itch to start blogging again so here goes.

I have some material already lined up: I've been teaching an introductory data science bootcamp at
work and thought the notebooks from that could be useful blog posts in and of themselves. So I'll
start slowly publishing those while I write some new material. I'm also going to expand the scope 
of this blog; I'll still cover some tech topics but I',m going to fold in the content from my
dormant math blog and retire it; this may inspire me to do some math blogging again. And I'll be 
throwing in some stuff on management and psychology too. So this will be a mishmash living up to 
the random forest name. I'll use categories to make it more accessible for those only interested
in specific topics.

More soon!
