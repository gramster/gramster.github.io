There's been some weird synchronicity going on recently. It started a
few weeks back at work. Earlier this year I wrote a compiler for
Javascript, and this resulted in a conversation with a workmate about
virtual machines. I mentioned the SECD machine and [Henderson's seminal
book](https://amzn.to/3FHfOAv)
from 1980 on functional programming. My workmate was interested enough
to order a copy, and we've had a number of conversations about
functional programming (which I haven't done in 20 years). At some point
in this process I ended up getting the [Google paper on
map/reduce](http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf#search=%22map%20reduce%22),
and the paper on [a history of
Haskell](http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/tmp/history.pdf#search=%22history%20of%20Haskell%22).
A few days later [Joel wrote about map/reduce and
Javascript](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/01.html) on his
blog. Then I ended up almost inadvertently getting a copy of Danny
Hillis' [Connection
Machine](https://amzn.to/3quf4Iu)
book.Â  Today I read [Eric Sink's posting about multicore CPUs and
Erlang](http://www.ericsink.com/entries/LarryO.html), in which he also
mentioned [Larry O'Briens blog](http://knowing.net) - so I head over
there and the [third posting
down](http://www.knowing.net/PermaLink,guid,beab1a93-151b-44b1-9d5e-a61f077ec036.aspx)
discusses a problem very similar to the deadlock issue I just posted
about.

Who knows what it all means? Maybe its time to learn
