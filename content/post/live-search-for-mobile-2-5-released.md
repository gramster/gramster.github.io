After 3 months we have finally released the latest version of Live
Search for Mobile. The Windows Mobile client now features speech input,
better location handling, hours of operation on search results, better
movie poster sizing. and gas prices. We spent about half the time on bug
fixes and stability improvements. It's a great release; get it at
[http://wls.live.com](http://wls.live.com/) on your phone (download
direct via your phone's browser).
