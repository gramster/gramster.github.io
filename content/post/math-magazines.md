[Quanta](https://www.quantamagazine.org/)
 is really a science magazine but has good articles of
interest to math fans.
[Mathematical Digest](http://www.mth.uct.ac.za/outreach/digest/archive.php)
 is a magazine that
has been produced for nearly 50 years now by Professor John
Webb of the University of Cape Town. I grew up on these in high
school and along with Martin Gardner's columns they fuelled my
love of math. I was privileged to be instructed by Prof. Webb
as an undergraduate math student as well; he was regularly
awarded honors as a distinguished teacher and these were
well-deserved.

Finally, there is [Manifold](http://freespace.virgin.net/ianstewart.joat/MANIFOLD/manifold_main.html),
a student magazine of the University
of Warwick, which is where the well-known math professor and
writer Dr Ian Stewart hails from. I haven't looked at these yet
but expect them to be interesting.

If you know of other sources of such magazines let me know in the
comments!
