My partner in crime on Live Search for Mobile, Ashley, has started a
coding blog, which is much more interesting than mine. He's currently
very into functional programming but with a C\# bent - basically a C\#
schemer - and there's some cool stuff he's been playing around with in
.Net 2.0 and 3.0. [Check it out!](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ashleyf/)
