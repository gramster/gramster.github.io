I tend to be one of those people who accumulates vast amounts of clutter
on my desk, in my room, and in my life, and then every couple of months
has a big cleanout, vowing to maintain the new uncluttered state, but
the cycle just begins again (I blame the laws of thermodynamics). In an
effort to break that cycle I've recently started paying some attention
to David Allen's [Getting Things Done](http://davidco.com) approach.

I haven't read his books (part of my clutter is a large number of unread
books; his book was among them for a while until it went back to the
library), but there is enough info on the web to get the idea. There is
also a good description in the wonderful book ['Micro-ISV: from Dream to
Reality](https://amzn.to/3197AC0)'
by Bob Walsh. One of the first things I did was look for software that I
could use to start implementing the GTD approach. The two main
contenders seemed to be Bob Walsh's own [Masterlist
Professional](http://safarisoftware.com/), which is very reasonably
priced at \$25, and a Ukrainian product called [MyLife
Organized](http://www.mylifeorganized.net/), which costs \$60. I
downloaded both and tried using them.
<!-- TEASER_END -->

Sadly (as I like everything else I've seen from Bob Walsh) Masterlist
Professional got eliminated almost immediately because it supports only
flat lists (projects broken into items). MyLife Organized, on the other
hand, supports tree structured hierarchical lists, which I find more
appropriate. So I'm about 5 days into the trial and am using MLO daily.
However, I find the price to be pretty exhorbitant for what is
essentially a glorified todo list manager. I could probably write my own
subset of MLO that does what I need in a few hours in C\#, and that
gives me the added benefits of (i) being able to customise it to my
liking and (ii) being able to sell it later if it is good enough. Watch
this space.

So far the biggest drawback of MLO seems to be that using the Pocket PC
version to try to keep two PCs in sync does not work; things get messed
up quickly. The developers suggest using a USB thumb drive to carry
thedaya file around on, but I opted for synching the data file to my
subversion server.

Unrelated note: Windows LiveWriter works great! It may make me update
this blog a lot more regularly.
