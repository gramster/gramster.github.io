Ashley, Steve and I are giving a talk at MEDC on our baby, Live Search
for Mobile. Ash will talk about interaction design for mobile, I'll talk
about lessons learned and useful tips for developing on Compact
Framework (Live Search is built on CF 1.0 SP3), and Steve will talk
about our uber-agile process. Stop by and say hi!

Update: you can see the video [here](http://blip.tv/file/220788) -
although it seems to bomb out before I started talking. When I saved it
to my local drive it worked fine, so I'm not sure what the issue is with
streaming it.
