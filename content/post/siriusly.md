My wife has SiriusXM in her car, and I really like their channel 53, SiriusXM Chill. I have struggled to find something similar; the closest 
I have found is Chilltrax, which was apparently started by the same people who originally created the Sirius channel. Chilltrax is
available on TuneIn, to which I have a premium subscription, but for some reason it almost never works on TuneIn in my Tesla.

I finally caved and figured I would subscribe to SiriusXM, just for this channel. I was disappointed to find the Tesla Model Y has no Sirius support; only the
Model S and X have the necessary hardware. So I went to the Sirius XM website. While browsing the offerings, I went to look at the channel lineup on their
music-only subscription. I found the Chill channel, and it showed a 'play' icon, so I thought I'd listen while finishing up subscribing. So I clicked 
on 'play'...

In stead of playing, this took me to a page where I was asked to create an account, with my email address and a password. Fine, I'm probably going 
to have to do that anyway to subscribe, so I went ahead, and I ended up with the channel playing. So far so good.

I then decided I wanted to do the subscribing. Clicking on that (or, it turns out, going through any number of other ways into trying to subscribe
on their website), and the first thing they wanted - "Step 1 of 3" - was for me to create an account. No option to log in to an account, and it made
no difference if I was already logged in. 

You can probably guess what happened next:

I spent quite a while trying to work around this. Maybe a different browser, or a different IP would help. Nope. Maybe I could delete the account and start over?
Going from the page where I was logged in and streaming music to 'manager account', I was once again presented with a login, and this time I got:

So basically I'm in some kind of second-class account, which I cannot manage or delete, and which prevents me from creating a proper account.

Time to get hold of their tech support; they should be able to fix it, right?

Nope.

Who comes up with these designs?
