One thing we have found is that our zoom UI is not very discoverable.
It'll probably change in the future as a result; it seems we
over-engineered it in the current app. But until we come up with a
replacement, here are some tips:

-   obviously you can use the menu Zoom In/Zoom Out to change the zoom
    by one level
-   if you hit the D-Pad center button you will go into 'zoom mode'.
    While in this mode you can use the right soft key or the D-Pad
    center button to increase the zoom level, and the left soft key to
    decrease the zoom level. You can also pan the zoom box around the
    map with the D-Pad direction keys. If you don't press any buttons
    for about two seconds, then the selected zoom will be performed, and
    zoom mode is exited
-   if you have a touch screen, you can also quickly double tap on a map
    location to zoom in to that location

I hope this helps!
