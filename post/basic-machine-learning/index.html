The other posts are:</em></p><ul><li><em><a href=/post/python-crash-course/>a Python crash course</a></em></li><li><em><a href=/post/using-jupyter/>using Jupyter</a></em></li><li><em><a href=/post/exploratory-data-analysis-with-numpy-and-pandas/>exploratory data analysis</a>.</em></li></ul><p>In this post we will look into the basics of building ML models with Scikit-Learn. Scikit-Learn is the most widely used Python library for ML, especially outside of deep learning (where there are several contenders and I recommend using Keras, which is a package that provides a simple API on top of several underlying contenders like TensorFlow and PyTorch).</p><p>We&rsquo;ll proceed in this fashion:</p><ul><li>give a brief overview of key terminology and the ML workflow</li><li>illustrate the typical use of SciKit-Learn API through some simple examples</li><li>discuss various metrics that can be used to evaluate ML models</li><li>dive deeper with some more complex examples</li><li>look at the various ways we can validate and improve our models</li><li>discuss the topic of feature engineering - ML models are good examples of &ldquo;garbage in, garbage out&rdquo;, so cleaning our data and getting the right features is important</li><li>finally, summarize some of the main model techniques and their pros and cons</li></ul><p>We are going to focus on practical ML, and will not be going much into the internal details of the various algorithms. We&rsquo;re also going to avoid the topics of <em>Deep Learning</em> and <em>neural nets</em>: these are generating a lot of hype at present but in general involve learning thousands of parameters requiring massive amounts of data for training (and a lot of time). The techniques we are going to look at can be used for much smaller problems and are generally very fast to train. It&rsquo;s worth having them in your toolkit and progressing to deep learning later.</p><blockquote><p>Getting good data and the right features is generally more important than the type of model
you choose to use. The performance of the different types of ML model techniques is often similar. It&rsquo;s commonly
said in ML circles that 80% of time is spent on getting data cleaned up and doing <em>feature engineering</em> and only 20%
is spent on modeling. For example, until around 2014 when deep learning started taking off, most ML models at Google
were trained using the same system (<a href=https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~niejiazhong/slides/chandra.pdf>Sibyl</a>), a form of boosted logistic regression that could be run on large data sets
with map-reduce. Deep learning has an advantage that it can
<em>learn</em> features that would otherwise need to be engineered by hand, and can thus automate some of the manual work
typically done by an ML engineer, but in order to do that, as mentioned above, it generally needs a massive dataset and
often days or weeks of compute time.</p></blockquote><h2 id=ml-terminology>ML Terminology</h2><p><em>Machine Learning</em> is the process of building models from data, either to gain insight into the data or to make predictions for new data (generalization). There are two main categories:</p><ul><li><em>supervised learning</em>, in which the data (<em>training data</em>) is labeled with an known outcome (this is the <em>supervision</em> part), and the aim is to predict new outcomes from new data; if the outcome is a category this is <em>classification</em> while if the outcome is a continuous quantity this is <em>regression</em></li><li><em>unsupervised learning</em>, in which the data is analyzed for underlying patterns to gain insight; common examples are <em>clustering</em> (finding similar cases), <em>outlier detection</em> (finding unusual cases), and <em>dimensionality reduction</em> (reducing the number of variables needed to represent the data, essentially a form of lossy compression)</li></ul><p>The data used in ML is typically tabular. The columns are called <em>features</em> while the rows are <em>instances</em> or <em>observations</em>. For supervised learning, we call the output the <em>target</em> or <em>label</em>. We&rsquo;ll often refer to the vector if features as X and the output (label) as y, and say that we&rsquo;re trying to find a function that approximates f(X)=y; this function is our <em>model</em> and is characterized by some <em>model parameters</em>. We usually choose the type or class of model, and then use ML techniques to learn the model parameters that minimize the <em>error</em> (the difference between the predicted and actual output). More generally we can think of this as an optimization problem, where we are trying to learn the parameters that minimize a <em>loss function</em>; that loss function is typically going to be some cumulative function of the errors; a common loss function is RMSE (root mean square of errors).</p><p>While we learn the model parameters, there are some other parameters we need to specify as inputs to the model too; these are called <em>hyperparameters</em>. For example, if we learn a decision tree model, the parameters might be the features being tested at each branch and the values they are being tested against, while the hyperparameters would include the depth that we want to limit the tree to. For a polynomial regression model, the parameters would be the coefficients of the polynomial, while the hyperparameters could include the degree of polynomial we want to learn.</p><h2 id=ml-workflow>ML Workflow</h2><p>A typical machine learning workflow begins with:</p><ul><li>getting the data</li><li>exploring and cleaning up the data (handling missing values, normalizing values, removing bad data and outliers, encoding data in appropriate representations, and more)</li><li>possibly creating some additional synthetic values (e.g. we could use linear regression to fit a higher-order polynomial by creating synthetic values that are existing values raised to the power 2, 3, etc; other common examples might be computing and including aggregate values like means and standard deviations of some of the original values)</li><li>picking a type of model to use, and configuring the initial hyperparameters</li></ul><p>After which we could do multiple iterations of:</p><ul><li>training the model</li><li>evaluating the results</li><li>adjusting the model type or the hyperparameters if the results are not yet satisfactory</li></ul><p>And this second phase could necessitate a return to the first phase, to get more data or create more synthetic features.</p><p>The hyperparameter tuning could be done manually or may itself be automated by doing a state-space search through the possible values.</p><p>After some number of iterations, if we have a model that improves upon existing capabilities, we would want to deploy it. For the model to be useful, new data that we apply the model to should have similar properties to the training data (i.e. we rely on our test set being representative of the new data). If this is not true (e.g. because the future is just different and unpredictable, or perhaps we have <em>overfit</em> the training data), the model likely will not generalize well. If it is true, then we may be done, at least for some time, but in many cases future data will eventually diverge from the past and the model will degrade. We thus need to get more recent data, retrain, retune, and redeploy. The cadence of these refreshes will depend on the particular problem we are addressing. For example, if we build a model to recognize species of flowers we may need to retrain very infrequently or possibly never, as the primary reason to retrain is that we discover species that the model has not accounted for. On the other hand, if we build a model to detect fraudulent behavior we are pitting the model against adversaries that are adaptive and intelligent and we may need constant refreshes.</p><h2 id=exploring-the-iris-dataset>Exploring the Iris Dataset</h2><p>We&rsquo;ll explore the famous iris flower dataset in this example. We&rsquo;ll eventually be trying to predict the species, so it will be a focus even in our initial exploratory work.

A very common approach if the number of features is not too high is to use a <em>pairplot</em> or <em>scatter matrix</em>, which plots multiple pairwise scatterplots for each combination of pairs of features, as well as the distribution of each feature. Pandas Dataframes have a <code>scatter_matrix()</code> method to do this but Seaborn has a similar <code>pairplot</code> API that is easier to use:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span>sns<span style=color:#ff79c6>.</span>set()

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src=output_8_0.png alt=png></p><p>In the pairplot, we&rsquo;re looking for several things:</p><ul><li>are there features that are strongly correlated (or strongly inversely correlated)? If so, we may want to exclude one of the features, to simplify the model;</li><li>are there obvious clusters, that may be linearly separable? If so we may get far with simple linear models (as opposed to more complex models like decision trees).</li><li>are there features which seem correlated but our intuition or domain knowledge tells us should not be? In this case we may be missing features that are important to the model (these are called <em>confounding variables</em>). For example, we may see a correlation between daily ice cream consumption and drive-by shooting rates. We shouldn&rsquo;t expect this. It may be that the confounding variable is weather - in hotter weather people are more likely to be outside, resulting in an increase in both ice cream consumption and drive-by shootings.</li><li>looking at the diagonal, are the distributions Gaussian (normal)? Some modeling techniques (e.g. Gaussian naive Bayes, logistic regression, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)) depend on the features having such a distribution.</li></ul><p>For classification, we ideally want a dataset that is balanced in the number of observations of each category. We can check this with:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic>print</span>(iris<span style=color:#ff79c6>.</span>groupby(<span style=color:#f1fa8c>&#39;species&#39;</span>)<span style=color:#ff79c6>.</span>size())

That is beyond the scope of this notebook; Google it if you need it. For this particular case of bimodal distributions, we would instead favor <a href=http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html>Gaussian mixture models</a>. As this is a simple dataset, we will ignore these complexities for now; we will discuss some options for cleaning the dataset by rescaling features later.</p><p>We&rsquo;re not going to remove any observations here, but its worth discussing ways in which we can detect and remove outliers. There&rsquo;s no one solution but there are several techniques that can be used, such as:</p><ul><li>looking at the distribution of values for a feature, and removing the top and bottom percentiles</li><li>computing the mean and standard deviation and removing items that are too far removed from the mean (typically something like 3x standard deviations from the mean)</li><li>of course, mean and standard deviation are themselves sensitive to outliers, so we might combine the above techniques: compute the mean and standard deviation of the data after dropping the top and bottom percentiles as in the first method, and then using that pair of mean and standard deviation applied to the full data set s in the second method.</li></ul><h2 id=a-simple-classification-model-to-predict-the-species>A Simple Classification Model to Predict the Species</h2><p>In practice, we would usually store the data in the form of a Pandas DataFrame or NumPy array, the <em>features matrix</em>, and assign it to a variable <code>X</code>.

In this case we would want to know what probability value to pick as a threshold to distinguish between 0/1 with maximum accuracy. There is a trade-off - as we move the threshold we may get more true positives but we&rsquo;re also going to get more false positives. The AUC shows this trade-off this accuracy for different thresholds.

In this section we&rsquo;ll look at a more sophisticated approach, namely cross-validation. We&rsquo;ll also see how we can use run into the problem of overfitting the data, and discuss the two concepts of bias and variance, and how these are traded-off.</p><h3 id=overfitting-the-training-data>Overfitting the Training Data</h3><p>Imagine that for our model, we just hashed the input features to the output label. If we ran this as a model, and passed the same training data in as test data, we would get an exact match every time, suggesting we have a 100% accurate model! But if we gave the model new data it hadn&rsquo;t seen, it would fail dismally, not even being able to predict a result. We could address this by using some kind of fuzzy matching of hash keys, so at least we could get predictions out, but the result is likely to be a poor model. This illustrates two problems:</p><ul><li>we shouldn&rsquo;t test with our training data or we are likely to get an unreasonable expectation of accuracy</li><li>the model may &lsquo;fit&rsquo; the training data very well but not generalize well to new data; we call this &lsquo;overfitting&rsquo;</li></ul><p>On the other hand, if we split into test and training data (where the test data is what we call a &lsquo;holdout set&rsquo;), we lose some of our training data. What to do? Fortunately, there is a way we can use all of our data for training <em>and</em> for testing, using <em>cross-validation</em>!</p><h3 id=cross-validation>Cross Validation</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s say we split the data in half; call the two halves H1 and H2. We could train a model on H1 and test it on H2, and get an accuracy A1. We could train a second model on H2 and test it on H1, and get an accuracy of A2. This suggests that if we train a model using all the data, the accuracy when tested on new data should be somewhere between A1 and A2.</p><p>In practice, we don&rsquo;t split in half. More generally, we will split the data into k pieces of <em>folds</em>, \(F_1\), \(F_2\), &mldr;, \(F_k\), and then build \(k\) models, where the \(n\)th model uses \(F_n\) as the test set and the remaining pieces excluding \(F_n\) as the training set. The \(k\) individual scores are then combined into a final score (mean and standard deviation). This is called <em>k-fold cross validation</em>. The size of each fold must be large enough to be a reasonable sample of the problem, while allowing enough repetitions of the train-test evaluation of the algorithm to provide a fair estimate of the algorithms performance on new data. Commonly-used values for k are 5 or 10, although we can go all the way to the extreme where \(k\) is the size of the training set; this is called <em>leave-one-out cross validation</em>. It is computationally expensive and the results have high variance.</p><p>We can do k-fold cross-validation in SciKit-Learn easily with <code>cross_val_score</code>:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#ff79c6>from</span> sklearn.model_selection <span style=color:#ff79c6>import</span> cross_val_score

</code></pre><h3 id=the-bias-variance-trade-off>The Bias-Variance Trade-Off</h3><p><em>Bias</em> is a measure of error, or how far off predictions are from reality, due to erroneous assumptions; high bias is a sign of underfitting. <em>Variance</em> is an error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set, and can be thought of as how closely the model fits to random noise in the training data (overfitting). Informally:</p><ul><li>bias is a measure of the error of the model against the training set</li><li>variance is a measure of how much worse the model does with the test set versus the training set</li></ul><p>What can we do if our model performs poorly? Assuming it is not just due to the data being completely random or having no actual dependence on our chosen features (in which case we will never be successful), we have several possible strategies:</p><ul><li>use a more complex model to get a better fit to training data, but at the risk of overfitting (reduce bias, increase variance)</li><li>use a simpler model because we may have overfit the training data (increase bias, reduce variance)</li><li>get more data to train on</li><li>add more features (we&rsquo;ll talk about this later)</li></ul><p>If we increased the complexity of our model, it would do better and better at fitting the training data, but at some point would start getting worse and worse at fitting the validation data. This is the <em>bias-variance trade-off</em>; you can see it in the plot below where the vertical dashes line is the sweet spot we want to find.</p><p><img src=/img/bias-variance.png alt="Bias-Variance Trade-Off"></p><h3 id=learning-curves>Learning Curves</h3><p>The first two options we have, around model complexity, assume that the data is a fixed size. The third option is to add more data. As we add more data the optimal model will change. Assuming we capture the complexity of the data we are modeling, at some point we should have diminishing returns where adding more data doesn&rsquo;t significantly improve the model. This means that if we have a lot of data, it can be useful to measure how well the model is doing as we are training it, so we can stop when we reach the point where the further improvements are negligible. If we plot the training and validation scores as a function of the size of the data set we get the <em>learning curve</em>.</p><p>We would expect that a model will overfit a small dataset and underfit a large dataset, where &lsquo;small&rsquo; and &rsquo;large&rsquo; are dependent on the complexity of the model. We would also expect in almost every case that the training score is better than the validation score(or equivalently the training error is lower than the validation error). So a typical learning curve will look like:</p><p><img src=/img/learning-curve.png alt="Learning Curve"></p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python></code></pre></div><p>Note that the curve converges to some score as the amount of data increases. If the error score for the training set is high, that is high bias; if the scores for test and training are similar we have low variance, but a large gap between them is high variance.</p><h3 id=grid-search>Grid Search</h3><p>Drawing plots of validation and learning curves can be useful except that in many cases models have multiple knobs (hyperparameters) to adjust; this makes using such visual aids more difficult. Instead, we can just train multiple versions of the model and have SciKit-Learn do the work, using a <em><a href=http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html>grid search</a></em>.</p><p>To do this, we need to create a dictionary, where the keys are the different model constructor arguments, and the values are lists of values that we want to try. Then we can have SciKit-Learn find the best values for the parameters with cross-validation using <code>GridSearchCV</code>:</p><pre><code>from sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV

grid = GridSearchCV(model, param_dict, cv=10)
grid.fit(X, y)
print(grid.best_params_)

final_model = grid.best_estimator_
</code></pre><p>It&rsquo;s also possible to use a list of dictionaries. SciKit-Learn will do an exhaustive search of the entire parameter space by default. <code>RandomizedSearchCV</code> can be used for a randomized search instead.</p><h2 id=feature-engineering-and-data-transforms>Feature Engineering and Data Transforms</h2><p>Apart from changing the model complexity, the main other strategies we have for improving our models are adding more data or adding more features and/or improving the existing features. We may be able to get more data from the problem domain, but in many cases we don&rsquo;t have that option. All is not lost though, as we can use other sources of data for dependent features, as well as sometimes synthesize new features from the features we are given. We will look at this in this section, along with ways of transforming our data to be more usable by our models.</p><p>SciKit-Learn helps us out here too; it supports a rich set of data transforms. The general approach is: create a transform, <em>fit</em> it to the data, and then apply it to <em>transform</em> the data. When new data arrives the previously fit transform can be applied to that for consistency. For the training data fit and transform can usually be combined into a call to <code>.fit_transform()</code>.</p><h3 id=rescaling-data-to-a-minmax-range>Rescaling Data to a Min/Max Range</h3><p>This can be done easily with:</p><pre><code>from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

X = Imputer(strategy='mean').fit_transform(X)

For example, the data may have city names, which we may want to turn into latitude/longitude, or perhaps include data like the population of the city. In such cases we would need to include the necessary tables to look up these features from the input features before fitting or predicting with the model.</p><p>Another common case is to improve the power of regression. Regression fits a line in 2D, or a plane in higher dimensions, but this is linear. What if a polynomial of higher order would be a much better fit? We can still use linear regression, all we need to do is add features that are higher-order powers of the input features!</p><p>Consider this data:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#ff79c6>%</span>matplotlib inline
