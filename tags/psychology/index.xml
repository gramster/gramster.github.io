In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll dig into personality patterns that people can exhibit. Everyone has some combination of the five factors, but how does that combination manifest as a personality type?
There are many different models of personality types, but one used in psychology and psychoanalysis is the categorization in the DSM - the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.</description></item><item><title>The 5-Factor Model of Personality</title><link>https://www.grahamwheeler.com/post/personality-and-relationships1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Apr 2018 21:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.grahamwheeler.com/post/personality-and-relationships1/</guid><description>Shankar Vedantam has a great NPR show/podcast, &amp;ldquo;The Hidden Brain&amp;rdquo;, and occasional appearances on NPR&amp;rsquo;s All Things Considered. In December he had a show on Evaluating Personality Tests. It was enjoyable, especially the Harry Potter Sorting Hat references, but I felt it was a missed opportunity because of the focus on Myers-Briggs, and the fact that he mentioned the Big-5 model only in passing.
In fact, Myers-Briggs is not taken very seriously in the psychology world, and Vedantam surprised me with spending so much time on it, given his show&amp;rsquo;s focus on research in psychology.</description></item></channel></rss>
