a Python crash course using Jupyter exploratory data analysis. In this post we will look into the basics of building ML models with Scikit-Learn. Scikit-Learn is the most widely used Python library for ML, especially outside of deep learning (where there are several contenders and I recommend using Keras, which is a package that provides a simple API on top of several underlying contenders like TensorFlow and PyTorch).</description></item><item><title>Exploratory Data Analysis with NumPy and Pandas</title><link>http://www.grahamwheeler.com/post/exploratory-data-analysis-with-numpy-and-pandas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Apr 2018 12:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.grahamwheeler.com/post/exploratory-data-analysis-with-numpy-and-pandas/</guid><description>This is the third post in a series based off my Python for Data Science bootcamp I run at eBay occasionally.

a Python crash course using Jupyter introductory machine learning. This is an introduction to the NumPy and Pandas libraries that form the foundation of data science in Python. These libraries, especially Pandas, have a large API surface and many powerful features. There is now way in a short amount of time to cover every topic; in many cases we will just scratch the surface.</description></item><item><title>Using Jupyter</title><link>http://www.grahamwheeler.com/post/using-jupyter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 21:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.grahamwheeler.com/post/using-jupyter/</guid><description>This is the second post in a series based off my Python for Data Science bootcamp I run at eBay occasionally.

a Python crash course exploratory data analysis. introductory machine learning. Jupyter is an interactive computing environment that allows users to create heterogeneous documents called notebooks that can mix executable code, markdown text with MathJax, multimedia, static and interactive charts, and more. A notebook is typically a complete and self-contained record of a computation, and can be converted to various formats and shared with others.</description></item><item><title>A Python Crash Course</title><link>http://www.grahamwheeler.com/post/python-crash-course/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Apr 2018 20:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.grahamwheeler.com/post/python-crash-course/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been teaching a crash course in data science with Python, which starts off with learning Python itself. The target audience is Java programmers (generally senior level) so its assumed that things like classes and methods are well understood. The focus is mostly on what is different with Python. I teach it using Jupyter notebooks but the content is useful as a blog post too so here we go.

Unfortunately, I didn&amp;rsquo;t find any good tools. There is TeX of course, which can do anything, but I was hoping for something a bit more WYSIWYGy. There are some very good tools available for musical scores (MuseScore, Frescobaldi), but I want something that is more like a traditional notebook with lots of notes interspersed with occasional musical notation (in both traditional and tablature forms).</description></item></channel></rss>
